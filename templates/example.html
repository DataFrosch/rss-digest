        <h1>üóûÔ∏è Your Weekly RSS Digest</h1>
        <p><strong>Week of Oct 14 - Oct 21, 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>THIS WEEK'S BIG PICTURE</h2>
<p>This week reveals a world facing simultaneous economic resilience and political fragility. While the global economy continues growing despite trade wars and AI disruptions, Europe is preparing for potential conflict with Russia, and major economies like the U.S. and China show internal weaknesses in their trade confrontation. Meanwhile, inflation concerns persist as governments struggle with overspending, and technological changes are reshaping everything from content creation to military strategy.</p>

<h2>TOP 3 ARTICLES TO READ</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/10/21/why-are-american-women-leaving-the-labour-force">Why are American women leaving the labour force?</a></h3>
<p>The article examines the surprising trend of American women exiting the workforce, exploring whether this represents a cultural shift toward traditional roles or has economic explanations. This demographic change could signal broader social and economic transformations.</p>
<p>Why it matters: Understanding these workforce dynamics could predict similar trends in European labor markets and impact economic forecasts.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h3><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/10/20/france-puts-a-former-president-nicolas-sarkozy-behind-bars">France puts a former president, Nicolas Sarkozy, behind bars</a></h3>
<p>France has jailed its former president Nicolas Sarkozy, marking the first time since Marshal P√©tain that a French ex-head of state has been imprisoned. This represents a significant moment for French political accountability and institutional strength.</p>
<p>Why it matters: This tests European democratic institutions and could influence anti-corruption efforts across the continent.</p>
</li>

<h3><a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/10/16/the-rich-world-faces-a-painful-bout-of-inflation">The rich world faces a painful bout of inflation</a></h3>
<p>Governments in wealthy nations are spending beyond their means, making inflation the most likely outcome for balancing budgets. This analysis suggests inflation may become the default solution for fiscal challenges.</p>
<p>Why it matters: This directly impacts ECB policy decisions and European investment strategies amid persistent price pressures.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>WHAT'S HAPPENING</h2>

<h3>IN EUROPE</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/10/16/grid-operators-in-the-baltics-and-poland-are-preparing-for-russian-attacks">Grid operators in the Baltics and Poland are preparing for Russian attacks</a></p>
<p>Energy infrastructure operators in Eastern Europe are installing blast walls, drone fences, and deploying special combat units to protect against potential Russian attacks. This represents a significant militarization of critical infrastructure in NATO's eastern flank.</p>

<h3>INTERNATIONALLY</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/10/15/the-america-v-china-spat-reveals-a-dangerous-dynamic">The America v China spat reveals a dangerous dynamic</a></p>
<p>The trade conflict between the U.S. and China shows both countries are weaker than they appear, creating an unstable "balance of economic terror." This great power competition threatens global economic stability that Europe depends on.</p>

<h3>IN THE MARKETS</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/10/15/would-inflation-linked-bonds-survive-an-inflationary-default">Would inflation-linked bonds survive an inflationary default?</a></p>
<p>The article explores what happens to inflation-linked bonds, considered among the safest assets, during periods of high inflation and potential government defaults. This examines the resilience of financial instruments that many European investors rely on for protection.</p>

<h2>DATA JOURNALISM OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labor force participation trends:</strong> Compare American and European female workforce participation rates over time, analyzing cultural and policy differences that might explain diverging trends</li>
<li><strong>Eastern European infrastructure vulnerability:</strong> Map critical energy infrastructure in Baltic states and Poland with historical attack data and defense spending</li>
<li><strong>Inflation-linked bond performance:</strong> Create interactive visualizations showing how different inflation scenarios affect bond returns across European markets</li>
<li><strong>Microfinance crisis indicators:</strong> Track Indian microfinance default rates against economic indicators to build early warning systems for similar programs in Eastern Europe</li>
<li><strong>Renewables storage gap:</strong> Analyze battery capacity versus renewable energy generation across European countries, highlighting Spain's experience as a case study</li>
<li><strong>Passport power dynamics:</strong> Build a time-series visualization of passport strength changes, particularly tracking the decline of American travel document power relative to European counterparts</li>
